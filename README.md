# Unet-Image-Denoise
using fully Convolutional network(UNet) to remove the noise in image. 
This model has only been tested on white gaussian noise. For other kinds of noise, you may have to 
find new dataset with the right training pair, one clean image, one noisy image with certain kind 
of noise distribution.
